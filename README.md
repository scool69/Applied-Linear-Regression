# My-Linear-Regression-Project
A regression analysis of gasoline mileage data is performed. The data set is taken from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/", "mcgillstat/regression/main/data/data-table-B3.csv".

First a multiple linear regression model was fitted relating gasoline mileage

y (miles per gallon) to engine displacement x1 and the number of carburetor

barrels x6

y = β0 + β1x1 + β6x6 + e.

2nd the analysis-of-variance table and test for significance was constructed

of regression. Define appropriate hypotheses for this test. Summarize the

conclusions to be made from this output.

3)Calculated R2 and adjusted R2 for this model. Compare this to the R2 and adjusted R2 for the simple linear regression model relating mileage y to engine displacement x1.

4)Used t tests to assess the contribution of each regressor to the model.

5)Found a 95% CI for β1.

6)Computed the t statistics for testing H0 : β1 = 0 and H0 : β6 = 0 .

7)Found a 95% CI on the mean gasoline mileage when x1 = 275 and x6 = 2.

8)Found a 95% prediction interval for a new observation on gasoline mileage when x1 = 275 and x6 = 2.

9)Computed SSRes, SSt and PRESS statistic.

10)Deleted half the observations (chosen at random), and refit the regression model to see how the model would change and behave

11)Compute R2 , adjusted R2, Cp, AIC and BIC for the following models

(a) Model 1

y = β0 + e

(b) Model 2

y = β0 + β1x1 + e

(c) Model 3

y = β0 + β6x6 + e

(d) Model 4

y = β0 + β1x1 + β6x6 + e
